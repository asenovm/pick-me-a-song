    <h3 class="text-justify">Number of neighbours</h3>
    Each time we make a recommendation we consider a number of users that are similar to you. Feel free to change this having in mind that lower count will result in a limited set of recommendations and considerably higher will result in broader, but less relevant ones. The default value is <strong>5</strong>.

    After finding the users that have the most similar tastes to yours, we decide how many of their most listened songs to recommend to you. You can enter this count in the following input. The default value is <strong>2</strong> (number of items recommended from the user with the least similarity to you).

    The work of the system can be based on 2 different algorithmic approaches - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering">Collaborative filtering</a> and <a href="http://recommender-systems.org/content-based-filtering/">Content-based filtering</a>. The first one finds suitable music for you by comparing your taste to the one thousands of other users have and recommends you their favourite songs. The latter uses meta information about the music you like and the music we have information about in order to find tracks that match your taste.
