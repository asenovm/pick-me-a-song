Pick me a song
==============

<h3>What it is?</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
    <strong>Pick me a song</strong> is a music recommender system that allows you to enter information about your favourite musicians and afterwards provides you with personalized suggestions based on that information. You can enter your music tastes either manually - by typing in a list of artists along with their importance for you or, conversely, we can pull this info from your Facebook profile.
</p>
<h3>How it works?</h3>
<p class="text-justify info-footer">
    The system is based on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering">Collaborative Filtering</a> algorithm that tries to find a list of users that have similar tastes to you and recommend you those of their favourite songs that you still haven't listened. The algorithm is using data from <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> in order to find similar users.
